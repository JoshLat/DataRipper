FRC Team 3098 Scouting Data Extraction Tool
Please View "DataRipper Documentation.pdf"
This Tool is used to transfer scouting data from scouting tablets to the master tablet using an ethernet cable.
This gives us the ability to pull scouting data whenever we want even during matches without having duplictae data
in the master tablet.
